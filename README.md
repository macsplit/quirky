# Quirky

Quirky is an uppercase English keyboard extension for the iPhone with an accompanying App that lets you assign a non-standard symbol for each key. Use it to provide emphasis or just add a little quirkiness to your text and messages.

## Usage

1. When the app is first run, in settings the keyboard can be enabled

2. The app has a list of keys and which character is produced
